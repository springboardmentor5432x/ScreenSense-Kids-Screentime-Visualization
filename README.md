# ScreenSense: Kids’ Screentime Visualization

## Problem Statement
In today’s generation, kids are spending more time on screens than ever before. Whether it’s tablets, smartphones, or computers, children are engaging in a variety of platforms including entertainment, games, and educational tools. While technology offers opportunities for learning and creativity, excessive screen time can lead to health issues, decreased productivity, and behavioral impacts.  

By analyzing kids’ screentime patterns, we can uncover trends based on age, gender, location type (urban/rural), device type, day-of-week usage, and activity category. Understanding these patterns helps parents, teachers, and policymakers make informed decisions about managing screen usage, promoting balanced digital habits, and ensuring healthy growth.

## Dataset
The dataset is provided by **Infosys Springboard Data Visualization Program** and contains detailed information about children’s screen usage. Key columns include:  
- **Age** – Child’s age in years  
- **Gender** – Male or Female  
- **Location Type** – Urban or Rural  
- **Device Type** – Tablet, Smartphone, TV, or Computer  
- **Day-of-Week** – Usage per day  
- **Activity Category** – Entertainment, Education, Gaming, etc.  
- **Screen Time (hrs/day)** – Daily duration of screen usage  
- **Health Impact** – Indicators like eye strain, headaches, or sleep disturbances  
- **Efficiency** – Productivity or engagement score relative to usage  

Analyzing this dataset helps parents, teachers, and policymakers understand trends, identify potential health risks, and design interventions or awareness programs to encourage balanced screen habits.

## Expected Outcomes
- **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and organize the dataset for analysis.  
- **Trend Analysis:** Explore usage patterns across weekdays/weekends, devices, and activity types.  
- **Visualization:** Present key metrics through bar charts, histograms, boxplots, heatmaps, and comparative visuals.  
- **Insights:** Summarize trends and actionable findings for non-technical stakeholders.  
- **Dashboard & Presentation:** Provide a final visual report/dashboard with all key insights and graphics for effective communication.
